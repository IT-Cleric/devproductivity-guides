## Support

ServiceNow built this integration with the intent to help customers get started faster in adopting CI/CD APIs for DevOps workflows, but __will not be providing formal support__. This integration is therefore considered "use at your own risk", and will rely on the open-source community to help drive fixes and feature enhancements via Issues. Occasionally, ServiceNow may choose to contribute to the open-source project to help address the highest priority Issues, and will do our best to keep the integrations updated with the latest API changes shipped with family releases. This is a good opportunity for our customers and community developers to step up and help drive iteration and improvement on these open-source integrations for everyone's benefit.
