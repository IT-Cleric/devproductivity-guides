## Open-Source and ServiceNow Support
KB article draft for ServiceNow Support teams on how to respond to inquiries on open-source projects and tools from customers.

Open-source projects are intended to leverage community-driven collaboration from maintainers and contributors to maintain and improve the software. Some of the key benefits:
- If you're a user of the software and find a bug or see potential improvements to be made, you can help to document and then contribute a pull request to address the changes.
- Changes from the community can be much faster to implement, allowing for a more iterative, agile development model, resulting in features getting out to everyone using the project faster. 
- More eyes on the code means more rigor in maintaining the codebase. 

For ServiceNow customers, this translates to a few key things to be aware of: 
- Customers need to evaluate the risk of relying on an open-source project that is not formally supported by ServiceNow. 
- Customers can consider providing engineering bandwidth to help contribute to fix bugs or make feature enhancements. 
- Customers can have a strong influence over the roadmap of these open-source projects as maintainers and contributors by supporting development. 

For any further questions, please submit Issues to the relevant open-source project.
